**Warsztaty Badawcze 2** · Laboratory / Project Repository · Group 2 · Spring 2026 @ PW

This repository contains all important information about the `Warsztaty Badawcze 2` course. Below are the details regarding the Lab and Project parts of the course, alongside individual group assignments and points for every part.

---

## 📚 Contents
The main goal of the project and laboratory part of the course is to expose you to the research landscape, methodologies, and practices. The course is aimed primarily at showcasing **how to execute research projects**.

In essence, it aims at answering questions like:
1. How do research projects work?
2. How to read research papers?
3. How to propose ideas for research?
4. How to pose research questions?
5. How to answer such questions? — conduct experiments.
6. How to conduct experiments and what is crucial to keep in mind?
7. How to present results?
8. How and where to send the results? (How publications work).

### 🗺️ Scope of the Project
We will guide you through every stage of the research cycle. However, to ensure we fit within the semester's timeline, we will bypass the initial phase of specifying the research topic and questions. Identifying a novel gap in a field is a time-intensive process of trial and error that requires deep immersion in existing literature. To maximize our time, we will provide a predefined general topic and specific research sub-questions. This allows us to focus entirely on the **mechanics of doing the research**. You will have plenty of opportunities to practice the ideation and verification stages (Questions 3, 4, and 8) during your Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD theses.

> 💬 **Note:** If you are interested in the publication side of research, there are many opportunities at PW to join projects that culminate in published papers. Please feel free to ask me for details!

### 🚀 Impact
By the end of this course, you will have the experience necessary to verify hypotheses, run rigorous experiments, reproduce results, and present your findings in a clear, professional manner.
While our focus is on Machine Learning, these skills are **universal**. The organizational methods and analytical rigor taught here are directly applicable to any experimental science, ML development role, or project-based professional environment.

## 🧑‍🔬 Lab

The laboratory portion consists of a series of scheduled meetings. We will begin with onsite meetings for the first few weeks before transitioning to a **hybrid (onsite/online)** setup. While there are clear collaborative benefits to attending in person, the hybrid phase does not strictly require physical presence (meaning you can connect online).

A few details:
- **Attendance is mandatory** for all laboratory sessions.
- 🏫 For sessions labeled **Onsite only**, physical attendance is required. If you have a valid reason for absence (illness or emergencies), please notify me in advance so we can handle it on a case-by-case basis.
- The dates between laboratory meetings are reserved for **individual group meetings**. These slots are dedicated to discussing your specific results, data interpretation, and next steps.

Below is a schedule of topics we'll discuss at the meetings.
Requirements or preparatory tasks for each date are listed in brackets `[...]`.

## 🏗️ Project

The project part of the course will be a step-by-step preparation of a full research project, consisting of a few parts. The **first part** will be individual. The **second part** will be a full research project in **groups of three**.

As mentioned in the **Contents** section, we'll start with a predefined general research topic — which for Group 2 will be **✨ Implicit Neural Cognitive Maps**.

---

### 👤 Part 1 — Individual Assignments

We'll first go through some preparation before diving into specific topics for subgroups.

- 🔁 **[Due 2026-03-09]** — You'll have to **reproduce a single experiment** from a list of papers prepared for you. This can be any experiment from a single research paper (reproduce a figure and compare). This will give you some idea of the skills required for the rest of the semester. You can message me with which table/figure you'd like to reproduce.

- 🎙️ **[Due 2026-03-16]** — Like how it's done at some conferences, we'll have a **2 Minute Papers** competition! Everyone picks a single paper (and announces it in the Group chat under a thread I'll start after the previous meeting), then prepares a single slide — or, if they wish, uses the whiteboard.

  I will assign points **[0–5]** based on the presentation. What will be valued:
  - Exactness w.r.t. the contents of the paper
  - Clarity of explanation
  - The idea, execution, and ingenuity

  **🏆 The first five people who pick the most interesting paper and present it in the clearest fashion will receive additional points:** 5 pts for 1st, 5 for 2nd, etc., down to 1 pt for 5th place.

- 👥 **[Due 2026-03-16]** — You'll need to **form teams of up to three** that will be your project teams for the rest of the semester. Alongside forming teams, you should also pick a topic for Part 2. The topics are detailed in the **Team Assignments** section below.

---

### 👥 Part 2 — Team Project

The general topic of the team projects is **Implicit Neural Cognitive Maps**.

In many frontiers of science and engineering — from aerospace design to protein folding — we face a fundamental **measurement bottleneck**. Determining the ground truth performance of a candidate solution often requires high-fidelity simulations or physical assays that can take days or cost thousands of dollars. Traditional optimization methods fail here because they treat the world as a collection of disconnected data points, requiring massive datasets that are simply impossible to gather.

This workshop introduces **Implicit Neural Cognitive Maps**, a paradigm shift that models performance not as a table of numbers, but as a **continuous, differentiable neural landscape**. By leveraging Sinusoidal Activation Networks (SIRENs), we can parameterize the entire search space into a "mental map" where the system can calculate the exact slope of success — the gradient at any coordinate — even in regions where **no measurements have ever been taken**.

Each team will be tasked with conducting experiments, evaluating the results, and presenting them in a **presentation** and a **short paper** (4 main + 1 appendix page, potentially more) on predefined topics.
These topics have been chosen so that both people **advanced** and **inexperienced** in ML find something enjoyable.

### 🧩 Team Assignments

Individual topics for each group are listed below. Details will be available in the individual repositories.

#### 🎯 Team 1: Smart Sampling for Hidden Rewards
You will address the measurement bottleneck where the ground truth performance of a system is prohibitively expensive to evaluate (e.g., high-fidelity CFD or crash tests).
In this scenario, every data point is a significant investment, necessitating an **active learning strategy** that treats the environment like a hidden board.

- Your initial task is to reconstruct 2D "toy" landscapes using the **absolute minimum number of probes**. You will iterate between evaluating the simulation and updating a SIREN-based surrogate to maximize information gain per measurement.
- You will compare your "optimizer-driven sampling" against standard systematic random sampling and passive learning baselines.
<!-- - You will leverage Bayesian Optimization (BO) combined with SIREN-based surrogates, utilizing utility functions such as Expected Improvement (EI) or Maximum Variance to guide the next coordinate choice. -->

#### 🧭 Team 2: Steering with Neural Gradients
This team develops the **navigation engine** based on the biological principle of Reward-Taxis — the mechanism by which organisms invigorate or slow movement based on the gradient of an attractant. Unlike traditional planners, this approach treats the performance map as a continuous, differentiable neural field.

- You will implement a 2D particle that navigates a learned SIREN landscape by computing the analytical gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \Phi(\mathbf{x})$ via automatic differentiation. You will test whether the agent can "feel" its way toward global peaks in a resolution-independent manner.
- Evaluate your "taxis" mechanism against discrete path-planners like A* or population-based search methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms.
<!-- - Utilize SIRENs to provide the high-quality first-order derivatives ($\nabla \Phi$) and second-order Hessians necessary for smooth, gradient-based navigation. -->

#### 🌫️ Team 3: Detecting Uncertainty in Neural Maps
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are prone to **"hallucinations"** — mispredictions of signals in regions where training data is sparse. This track focuses on **quantifying model doubt** (epistemic uncertainty) to ensure the agent only trusts valid peaks.

- You will train multiple SIRENs on a sparse dataset and measure the variability across their predictions. You will create **blind spot maps** where the committee of models disagrees, using this signal to trigger more data gathering in high-uncertainty regions.
- Compare the effectiveness of **Deep Ensembles** against single-model single-pass techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) and REV-INR.
<!-- - Implement a Deep Ensemble architecture and use metrics like semantic entropy or per-pixel variance to differentiate between aleatoric (data noise) and epistemic (model lack of knowledge) uncertainty. -->

#### ⚡ Team 4: Navigating Implicit Fields with Physics Priors
Optimization in real-world systems must satisfy safety constraints that are often non-convex and non-smooth. You will transform these constraints into **"repulsive force-fields"** so the system's steering gradient naturally avoids hazardous or invalid regions.

- Build a navigation task where an agent must reach a goal while traversing a landscape containing a Gaussian barrier obstacle. You will integrate specialized penalty terms into the SIREN training loss to ensure collision-free exploration.
- Compare your physics-aware search against purely data-driven **Neural ODEs**, which often generalize poorly or lack stability under sparse data conditions.
<!-- - Use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) or Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to embed governing laws, and explore the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) to handle complex geometry without explicit meshing. -->

#### 🏅 Team 5: Decoding Progress from Win/Loss Outcomes
In long-horizon tasks, the only feedback available is often a single **Success/Failure** signal at the end, leading to the **credit assignment problem**. You will back-calculate stepwise progress from these sparse outcome labels.

- You will test your framework on multi-turn reasoning environments (e.g., VisualSokoban or WebShop) where you must determine which intermediate decisions were responsible for task success.
- Evaluate your dense progress signals against vanilla RL with sparse rewards or traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.
<!-- - Implement iStar (Implicit Step Rewards) to learn a process-based reward model via a multi-turn DPO objective, or PRIME to generate dense token-level signals that stabilize training in long trajectories. -->

> 📂 All teams will have a designated repository created on GitHub where all communication, experiments, and results will be gathered.
> 📖 Essential literature has been provided in the [literature.md](./literature.md) file.

### 💬 Feedback
Aside from points, I'll send (or tell) you group or individual feedback on your work.
I know that it's not always a matter of missing skills or not doing the work — sometimes you simply don't have time for everything while being a student. But from my experience, the amount of insightful and substantive feedback one receives **significantly accelerates development**.

Please don't treat feedback from me as something negative, but as a **sign of respect** for your time and the work you did. I'll mostly direct your attention to things worth considering, and if issues arise — whether there's something worth fixing.

### 🤖 Use of LLMs, Agents, and Generative Models
While I'm skeptical about the uncritical use of such tools, I don't ban their use in the course. Everyone can use them in their work. I invite you to **dive into discussions** on the use of these tools and the impact they have on learning capability — both on Slack and during the meetings.

With that, I will require a **dedicated section in the final paper** regarding the use of such tools (this section will not count toward the overall length limit or the appendix page).
